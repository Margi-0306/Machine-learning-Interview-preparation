# Given a sample with n observations, how could you test a hypothesis?

To test a hypothesis given a sample with n observations, you generally follow these steps:

## State the Hypotheses:

1. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or difference.
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or difference.
   
## **Choose the Significance Level (Œ±)**: 
Common choices for Œ± are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.

## Select the Appropriate Test:

The choice of test depends on the type of data and the hypothesis. Common tests include the t-test, z-test, chi-square test, ANOVA, etc.

## Calculate the Test Statistic:
The formula for the test statistic depends on the chosen test. For example, for a one-sample t-test, the test statistic ùë°
t is calculated as: (Mean - u)/ (s/square root(n))
Mean is the sample mean
u  is the population mean under the null hypothesis
s is the sample standard deviation
n is the sample size

## Determine the Critical Value or P-value:
For a given Œ±, find the critical value from the statistical table corresponding to the test statistic. Alternatively, calculate the p-value, which is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.

## Make a Decision:
Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value: If the test statistic exceeds the critical value (in magnitude for two-tailed tests), reject the null hypothesis.
Compare the P-value to Œ±: If the p-value is less than Œ±, reject the null hypothesis.
## Draw a Conclusion:
Based on the decision, conclude whether there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

# What are the Assumptions of ANOVA.
Anova : Analysis of variance : If we want to compare more than 2 samples means so we are using anova test for that. In avova test we are using one factor is called f measure.
H0 = Null hypothesis will say mean of all sample should be same
HA = Alternative hypothesis will mean of all sample wont be same.

# What test would you use for a small sample?
For small sample test we can use t test. under t test it will depend which test we have to use means 1 tail t test and 2 tail t test.

# What is the null hypothesis? 
Hypothesis means assumatation according to business requirment we have to do some assumation and with some sample we have to perform tesimg so we are using advance statistics. 2 type of Hypothesis testing. First null : It will say that no changes in previous statment. and second aleternative hypothesis : it will say that changes in old statment 

# What are type 1 and type 2 errors?

## Type 1 Error (False Positive)
Definition: A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis  is true, but we incorrectly reject it. Essentially, it's a "false positive" ‚Äî detecting an effect that is not actually present.
Probability: The probability of committing a Type 1 error is denoted by the significance level ùõº
Œ±. Common choices for Œ± are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.
Example: If a medical test incorrectly indicates that a healthy person has a disease, this is a Type 1 error.
## Type 2 Error (False Negative)
Definition: A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis (H 0 ) is false, but we fail to reject it. Essentially, it's a "false negative" ‚Äî failing to detect an effect that is actually present.
Probability: The probability of committing a Type 2 error is denoted by ùõΩ
Œ≤. The power of a test (1 -Œ≤) is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
Example: If a medical test fails to detect a disease in a person who actually has the disease, this is a Type 2 error.

# Use the following tables to write a query to retrieve data for customers who registered in the past ten days and spent over $100. Write another query to retrieve data for customers that spent over $100 in the past seven days. The first table is a customer purchase table with five columns: customer id, purchase date, product id, unit price, and units purchased. The second table is a customer details table with two columns: customer id and registration date.
